# Bruton Family Hub Frontend

React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui friendly skeleton, ready to become a PWA.

## Quick start

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev -- --host
```

The dev server proxies API calls to http://localhost:8000 and websocket traffic to ws://localhost:8000.

## Styling

- TailwindCSS with shadcn presets lives in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Shared styles in `src/styles/globals.css`
- Components generated by shadcn/ui should land under `src/components/ui`

## PWA

The `public/manifest.webmanifest` file plus upcoming icons allow installability once HTTPS is available behind Caddy (service worker to be added later).
